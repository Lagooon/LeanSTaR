Given the above goal and the given the target tactic `apply lt_of_le_of_lt`, I should produce a reasoning that only based on the goal, and conclude to the exact `apply lt_of_le_of_lt`, but not in the hindsight format.

### REASONING

To establish the strict inequality between the cardinalities of two sets, it is essential to first show that the cardinality of one set is less than or equal to the cardinality of another set, and then demonstrate that it is strictly less than a third set's cardinality. This approach utilizes the transitivity of inequality in the context of cardinalities under the assumptions of linear independence and finite dimensionality of the module \(M\).

Given the above goal and the given the target tactic `unfold angle`, I should produce a reasoning that only based on the goal, and conclude to the exact `unfold angle`, but not in the hindsight format.

### REASONING

The objective is to show that the angle formed by points `p2`, `p1`, and `p3` is 0, which necessitates analyzing the geometric relationship between these points. Given the vector representation `p3 -ᵥ p2 = r • (p1 -ᵥ p2)` and `r < 0`, it implies a scaling in the direction opposite to `p1 -ᵥ p2`. To formalize this understanding in terms of angles, we need to refer to the definition of `angle` in this context, which requires expanding its definition.

Given the above goal and the given the target tactic `exact (h' i).mono hi`, I should produce a reasoning that only based on the goal, and conclude to the exact `exact (h' i).mono hi`, but not in the hindsight format.

### REASONING

The objective is to establish the satisfiability of a finite set of sentences `T0` from the language `L`. Given that each theory `T i` in the family is satisfiable and there exists a theory `T i` that includes all sentences from `T0`, the satisfiability of `T0` directly follows from the satisfiability of `T i` by applying the principle of monotonicity in satisfiability: a subset of a satisfiable set of sentences is also satisfiable.

### REASONING

To prove the equivalence between `oangle o x y = ↑π` and `InnerProductGeometry.angle x y = π`, we start by considering the possible scenarios for the vector `x`. Specifically, whether `x` is the zero vector or not, as its nature fundamentally affects the angle measurements in both the general and inner product geometric contexts.

### REASONING

To prove the existence of an element `y` in the set `s` such that `x ≤ y`, we must consider all possible scenarios regarding the topological position of `x`. Specifically, we need to address whether `x` is a top element in the ordered space, as this could directly impact its relationship with elements in the dense set `s`.

### REASONING

The objective is to show the equivalence of `span R s ^ 0` and `span R (s ^ 0)` in the context of algebra over a commutative semiring. This is approached by recognizing that raising a set or a span to the power of zero corresponds to the algebraic structure's multiplicative identity, which is the span of the set containing only the multiplicative identity of the algebra.

### REASONING

To show that the supremum of the comap of `f` over the set `s` equals `⊤`, we start by utilizing the non-emptiness of `s`, which allows us to select an element from `s`. This step is foundational for constructing an argument or example needed in the proof.

### REASONING

To prove that the element `p * q` is idempotent in a semigroup structure, we leverage the properties of commutativity and idempotency of `p` and `q`. The essence of the proof involves manipulating the expression `(p * q) * (p * q)` to eventually show it equals `p * q`, using the given commutativity of `p` and `q`, alongside their idempotent properties, through a series of associative rearrangements.

### REASONING

The goal seeks to establish an equivalence between the support of a single state in a finite set and the support of that state's transition in a Turing machine's set of statements, within the context of a Turing machine's semantics. Simplification using the definition of `Supports` directly addresses this by breaking down the equivalence into its constituent conditions based on the semantics of Turing machine states and their transitions.

### REASONING

To establish the equality of the `.val` of two `Finset`s, we leverage the properties of an Eulerian path and the definition of an incidence `Finset` in a graph. The objective is to show that the set of edges incident to a vertex `x` in graph `G` can be precisely determined by filtering the edges of an Eulerian path `p` that include `x`, aligning with the characterization of Eulerian paths and the incidence relation in `G`.

### REASONING

To establish that `f` has a derivative within `Iic a` at `a`, focusing on the behavior of `f` as it approaches `a` from the left is crucial, given the provided conditions about its differentiability and limit properties on subsets of the real numbers. This leads us to consider the open interval `(b, a)` as a key subset where these properties can be explicitly analyzed, hence defining such an interval becomes necessary.

### REASONING

To prove the equality of the integrals over a set `t`, the finiteness condition of the measure of `t` represented by `ht' : ↑↑μ t < ⊤` is not directly relevant to the algebraic manipulation or property application required for the proof. Therefore, it can be safely removed from the hypothesis without affecting the logical progression towards proving the desired equality of integrals.

### REASONING

The theorem aims to establish an equivalence between a point `p i` belonging to the affine span of a set `p '' s` and the index `i` being a member of the set `s`. Affine independence and the properties of affine spans dictate that a point generated by a mapping `p` is in the affine span of the image of a set `s` under `p` if and only if the original point's index is in `s`. This equivalence inherently suggests the construction of an `iff` statement, justifying the initiation of a proof by constructing each implication separately.

### REASONING

The objective is to show that the integral of a function over the union of two disjoint, measurable sets lies within the open segment defined by the integrals over the individual sets. A crucial step involves demonstrating that the measures of these sets are strictly positive and finite, which is fundamental to applying certain theorems in measure theory that relate the measure of sets to the properties of integrals over those sets. The given step transitions from asserting non-zero and non-infinite measures to establishing a strictly positive real measure for set `s`, which is a necessary condition for the integrability and further analysis of `f` over `s`.

### REASONING

To prove that the elements of two circulant matrices generated by vectors `v` and `w` are equal at any given index, we leverage the property that circulant matrices are entirely defined by their first column. Thus, equating the matrices implies their corresponding generating vectors are equal at every index.

### REASONING

To establish the equivalence between `q ≤ toNNRat p` and `↑q ≤ p`, we need to understand how rational numbers and their non-negative counterparts are related in terms of their orderings. This involves interpreting the ordering of non-negative rationals in terms of the ordering of general rationals, precisely by analyzing the coercion from non-negative rationals to rationals, especially in the context provided by the non-negativity of `p`.

### REASONING

To prove that `a - b ≤ 0`, we must show that the subtraction of `b` from `a` results in a value that is less than or equal to zero.

### REASONING

To establish the equality of compositions involving `Subobject.ofLE` and the identity morphism on the underlying objects of `imageSubobject f` and `kernelSubobject g`, we leverage properties of subobject relations and their compositions under the assumption that `imageSubobject f = kernelSubobject g`. This approach simplifies the expressions to identities by directly applying the relevant simplification rules related to subobject compositions and identities.
