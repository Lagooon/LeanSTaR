            "Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be "
            "depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between "
            "renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\n\n"
            "1. Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable "
            "energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\n"
            "2. Environmental impact: Renewable energy sources have a much lower environmental impact "
            "than non-renewable sources, which can lead to air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, "
            "and other negative effects.\n"
            "3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically "
            "have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\n"
            "4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote "
            "locations than non-renewable sources.\n"
            "5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different "
            "situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\n"
            "6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while "
            "non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability.\n"
            "7. Scalability: Renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, can be scaled from single households to "
            "entire cities. Non-renewable sources usually require large, centralized power plants to be effective, "
            "making it harder to use them on a smaller scale.\n"
            "8. Extraction and Procurement: The extraction of non-renewable energy sources can be dangerous and involves "
            "extensive mining or drilling, which can harm ecosystems and endanger workers. Conversely, the 'harvesting' "
            "of renewable energy is generally safer and non-invasive.\n"
            "9. Energy Storage: Renewable energy sources can be less predictable and their availability may vary "
            "(like wind and solar). This requires advanced energy storage solutions or backup power, "
            "often still provided by non-renewable sources. Non-renewable sources typically provide a steady, "
            "constant supply of energy.\n"
            "10. Energy Security: With renewable energy, countries can produce energy domestically and reduce their "
            "dependency on foreign oil or gas, increasing their energy security. Non-renewable sources can lead to "
            "geopolitical issues, as countries with large reserves can influence the global economy and political landscape.",

            "Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a relatively "
            "short amount of time, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. "
            "Non-renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually be "
            "depleted, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Here are some key differences between "
            "renewable and non-renewable energy sources:\n\n"
            "1. Source of Energy: Renewable energy is generated from natural sources that can be replenished over a short period of time. Examples include wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy. Non-renewable energy, on the other hand, comes from sources that cannot be replenished in a short time period, such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n"
            "2. Environmental Impact: Renewable energy sources generally have lower environmental impact when compared to non-renewable energy. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases and other pollutants, contributing to climate change and air pollution. Meanwhile, renewable sources like wind and solar energy produce little to no emissions during operation.\n"
            "3. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are considered sustainable because they will not run out as long as the Sun keeps shining and the wind keeps blowing. Non-renewable energy sources, however, are finite and will eventually deplete.\n"
            "4. Reliability: Non-renewable energy sources like coal and gas-fired power plants can provide consistent power as they are not affected by weather conditions or the time of day. Renewable energy, while increasingly reliable with the advancements in technology, can be intermittent, with solar power dependent on daylight and wind power dependent on wind speed.\n"
            "5. Cost: Renewable energy technology costs have been decreasing significantly over the years, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. However, the initial set-up costs can be higher. Non-renewable energy sources, particularly coal, have traditionally been cheaper but don't reflect their environmental cost.\n"
            "6. Energy Storage: Due to the intermittent nature of many renewable energy sources, energy storage systems like batteries are often needed to provide power when the source isn't available. This is less of a concern with non-renewable sources, which can typically generate power on demand.\n"
            "7. Geographical Limitations: Some forms of renewable energy can only be utilized in specific geographical locations. For instance, hydropower requires a water source with sufficient flow, while solar power is most efficient in areas with high sun exposure. Non-renewable energy sources can generally be used almost anywhere, provided the necessary infrastructure is in place.\n"
            "8. Infrastructure and Development: Non-renewable energy sources have well-established extraction, distribution, and usage infrastructure worldwide. Renewable energy sources, while growing rapidly, require significant investment and development for similar levels of infrastructure.\n"
            "9. Energy Density: Non-renewable energy sources, particularly fossil fuels, have high energy densities, meaning they can produce a large amount of energy relative to their volume. Renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar, have lower energy densities, requiring larger areas to produce the same amount of energy.\n"
            "10. Health Impacts: The extraction and burning of non-renewable energy sources can have significant health impacts, contributing to respiratory issues and other health problems due to air and water pollution. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, have minimal health impacts, making them a cleaner alternative.",
